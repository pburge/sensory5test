INSTRUCTIONS 

This is a bonus/wild card test. Show me something spectacular in this space that illustrates your HTML5/CSS3 and design skills. 

Build an adaptive, mobile-first web page that lists 
the five best sources of CSS3 and HTML5 information 
that you visit on a regular basis. List the name, 
URL, and description of each site and why you find 
that source/site to be both relevant and important.
