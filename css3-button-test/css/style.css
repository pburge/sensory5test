INSTRUCTIONS

The button in the following image was created with CSS:

http://packages.sensory5.com/images/css-test.png

Your job is to recreate, using CSS properties alone, 
the button depicted in the image above. 

Spend no longer than 30 minutes on it, I don't 
expect it to be a perfect match. It's open book, 
and you may use Google for research, but be 
prepared to explain your solution.

Good luck and have fun with it!
